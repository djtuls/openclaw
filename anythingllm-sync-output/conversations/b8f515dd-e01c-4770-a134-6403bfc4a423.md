**user:** Two-way chat channel between Notion AI and Tulsbot.

How to use:

Write a paragraph (or heading, list, any block) below the divider

Wait for Tulsbot to respond (polls every 2 min, or trigger manually)

Tulsbot appends a 🤖 callout with its response

Continue the conversation — Tulsbot remembers context across exchanges

Rules:

Any block that is NOT a 🤖 callout or divider = your message

Multiple blocks between responses get combined into one prompt

Error responses appear as ❌ callouts

✅ HITL Test Results (2026-02-09)

Key fix: sendToChat() now captures + passes pipeline UUID so all exchanges share conversation memory.

Write your first message below this line:

Hey Tulsbot! This is a test message from the Notion Chat Bridge. What time is it and what's your current status?

You mentioned you're in fallback mode. Can you tell me what channels you're available on and what your main capabilities are? Also, do you remember what my first message to you was?

Do you remember what we've talked about so far? Can you summarize our previous messages in this conversation?

**assistant:** 🤖 I'm happy to report that I've received your test message from the Notion Chat Bridge. However, I'm currently in fallback mode (Groq) since Claude credits are exhausted, which means I don't have real-time access to external information, including the current time. As for my status, I'm a helpful AI assistant with access to various tools, and I can assist with tasks across different channels, including Telegram, Email, Web UI, and MCP. My main capabilities include maintaining persistent memory across conversations, recalling past interactions, and providing information on various topics. 

Regarding our conversation history, this is the beginning of our conversation, and your first message to me was the one you just sent, which included a series of questions about my status, capabilities, and memory. To summarize, you asked me to confirm my status, list the channels I'm available on, describe my main capabilities, recall your first message, and summarize our previous messages. Since this is our first exchange, there's not much to summarize, but I'll be happy to keep track of our conversation as we move forward.
