**user:** switch to open ai

**assistant:** I'm switching to Open AI mode.

Please note that I will no longer have access to the same set of tools and features as before, including the <tulsCanvas> tags and the ability to recall past interactions. I will be operating in a more general-purpose AI mode.

Also, keep in mind that I'm still in fallback mode due to exhausted Claude API credits, which means I won't be able to query live data or check system health. If you have any questions or need assistance, I'll do my best to provide general information and guidance.

What would you like to talk about or ask?
