**user:** restart now button is not working

**assistant:** I'm currently in fallback mode (Groq) since Claude credits are exhausted. I can't query live data, but here's what I know from the system blueprint: 

Regarding the "Restart Now" button not working, I can provide some general troubleshooting steps. However, please note that I don't have real-time access to the system, and actual troubleshooting may require live system access.

Some possible causes for the "Restart Now" button not working include:

1. **Permissions issue**: The user attempting to restart the system might not have the necessary permissions.
2. **System overload**: The system might be experiencing high load or resource constraints, preventing the restart operation.
3. **Configuration issue**: There could be a misconfiguration or a problem with the restart script.

To troubleshoot, you can try checking the system logs for any error messages related to the restart operation. Additionally, verifying the system's configuration and permissions might help identify the issue.

If you need further assistance or live system troubleshooting, Claude with tool access and API credits would be required.
