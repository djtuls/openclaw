**user:** I need the ability to add channels

**assistant:** To add channels, you'll need to modify the configuration. I'll provide you with a sample configuration file that includes the necessary settings.

<tulsCanvas id="add-channels-config" type="code" title="Add Channels Configuration" language="typescript">
```typescript
// Define the available channels
const channels = {
  telegram: {
    enabled: true,
    apiKey: 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_KEY',
  },
  email: {
    enabled: true,
    smtpServer: 'YOUR_SMTP_SERVER',
    smtpPort: 587,
    smtpUsername: 'YOUR_SMTP_USERNAME',
    smtpPassword: 'YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD',
  },
  webUi: {
    enabled: true,
    port: 8080,
  },
  mcp: {
    enabled: true,
    apiUrl: 'https://YOUR_MCP_API_URL',
  },
};

// Add a new channel (e.g., Discord)
channels.discord = {
  enabled: true,
  apiKey: 'YOUR_DISCORD_API_KEY',
  apiUrl: 'https://discord.com/api',
};

// Export the updated channels configuration
export default channels;
```
</tulsCanvas>

To add a new channel, simply create a new property in the `channels` object and configure the necessary settings. Make sure to update the `enabled` property to `true` to enable the new channel.

Please note that you'll need to replace the placeholder values (e.g., `YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_KEY`) with your actual API keys and credentials.

Also, keep in mind that I'm currently in fallback mode (Groq) since Claude credits are exhausted. I can't query live data, but the above configuration should give you a good starting point for adding new channels.

**user:** tell tulsbot to do that

**assistant:** I'll guide you through the process of adding a new channel to Tulsbot.

To add a new channel, I'll need to update the `channels` configuration. Here's an example of how to do it:

<tulsCanvas id="update-channels-config" type="code" title="Update Channels Configuration" language="typescript">
```typescript
// Define the available channels
const channels = {
  telegram: {
    enabled: true,
    apiKey: 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_KEY',
  },
  email: {
    enabled: true,
    smtpServer: 'YOUR_SMTP_SERVER',
    smtpPort: 587,
    smtpUsername: 'YOUR_SMTP_USERNAME',
    smtpPassword: 'YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD',
  },
  webUi: {
    enabled: true,
    port: 8080,
  },
  mcp: {
    enabled: true,
    apiUrl: 'https://YOUR_MCP_API_URL',
  },
};

// Add a new channel (e.g., Discord)
channels.discord = {
  enabled: true,
  apiKey: 'YOUR_DISCORD_API_KEY',
  apiUrl: 'https://discord.com/api',
};

// Export the updated channels configuration
export default channels;
```
</tulsCanvas>

To add a new channel to Tulsbot, I will execute the following command: 
`UPDATE_CHANNELS_CONFIG` with the updated `channels` configuration.

Please note that I'm currently in fallback mode (Groq) since Claude credits are exhausted. I can't query live data or execute the command directly, but the above configuration should give you a good starting point for adding new channels. 

Once the `UPDATE_CHANNELS_CONFIG` command is executed with the updated configuration, Tulsbot should be able to recognize and interact with the new channel. 

Would you like me to provide more information on how to execute the `UPDATE_CHANNELS_CONFIG` command or configure the new channel?
