**user:** use opus - test smart fallback

**assistant:** I'm currently in fallback mode (Groq) since Claude credits are exhausted. I can provide general information and answer questions based on my training data, but I won't be able to query live data or perform real-time tasks. 

If you'd like to test the smart fallback capabilities, I can try to provide helpful responses based on my knowledge and understanding of the system. Please keep in mind that my responses will be limited to the information I have available in my training data, and I won't be able to provide real-time updates or live system information.

What would you like to test or discuss?
