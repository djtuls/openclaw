The primary architecture revolves around Tulsbot 2.0 as the central hub, utilizing a hierarchical structure with distinct zones and databases. New pages created by Tulio are intended to mirror real-life working areas and must adhere to the Tulsbot 2.0 master structure and policies. The Tulsbot.md file serves as live instructions, always to be fetched at session start.
