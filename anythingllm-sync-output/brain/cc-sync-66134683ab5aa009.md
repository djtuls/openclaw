All project information, including plans, tasks, and documentation, is stored in Notion. The `2ff51bf9731e806b81a3f4046740fac7` page serves as the root, and a strict structure is enforced to maintain consistency and organization. The Tulsbot 2.0 dashboard (`30151bf9-731e-80b3b4e0ca86f2bf73a1`) acts as the primary interface for interacting with this knowledge base.
