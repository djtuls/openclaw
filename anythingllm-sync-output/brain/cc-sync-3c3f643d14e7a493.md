The Tulsbot 2.0 dashboard is organized into six zones: Command Center, System Status, Workspaces, Knowledge & Memory, Documentation, and Archive. The 'Tulsbot.md' file is always fetched at session start, providing live instructions. The dashboard's structure mirrors the hierarchical organization of the project's sub-items.
