The primary architecture revolves around a central Notion database (`30151bf9-731e-8114-b05f-d813e9f365e7`) as the single source of truth, connected to various services via API endpoints. Key components include PostgreSQL and Qdrant for data storage and retrieval, Redis for caching, and a Docker-based deployment strategy for scalability and portability. The system utilizes a hybrid approach, combining local execution with cloud-based services like OpenAI and Google Cloud.
